## Project Description

Simple font distribution site that allows users to browse and download from a curated library of fonts. It features a clean and easy-to-navigate interface tailored for creatives (graphic designers, developers, filmmakers, etc.). The main feature is its search system, which offers more control and freedom than existing font sites, supporting both basic filtering and subjective search queries (e.g., "Sci-fi logo text," "Coming of age title card").
