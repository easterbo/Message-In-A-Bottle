## Project Description

Spotify add-on application that allows users to browse and select a number of songs from the spotify library. The functionality of the app is such that upon two users with the application encountering, the devices with the app installed 'trade' a song from each of their selections, storing up to a maximum of five throughout a day. Once the app is opened post 'trade', the user is able to listen to whichever songs they have recieved. Each user's profile contains statistics and a taste map, allowing them to be viewed and searched. This app is aimed towards those with an interest in music, or who would enjoy diversifying their music taste.
